# Project overview

The **Eazzy.Meals** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD5111 subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to Display meal options based on the time of day.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to provide a user with a variety of meal options based on the time of day, making it fun and easy for a user to use. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: User login functionality
- Feature 2: Display random meal options per time of day
- Feature 3: Clear button, enter button and exit button
- Feature 4: First screen displays where the user will enter the time of day having the enter button as well as the clear button and exit button
- Feature 5: Second screen displays meal choices based on the time of day inputed on the first screen as well as a back button

These features aim to provide The best meals suited for the user.

## Design Considerations:

The design of the **Eazzy.Meals** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.


## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

## GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: Linking the two screens to work effortlessly 
   - **Solution**: I looked at a previous app developed (calculator app) and incorporated my own code
   
2. **Challenge 2**: Having the time of day match with the specific meal option 
   - **Solution**: I did research on Youtube as well as speak to Mr.J.Sookah for clarity

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: Ingredient list
2. **Feature 2**: Having a 3rd screen
3. **Feature 3**: A way to share the meal options with a friend
These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
