# Project description:

The **Eazzy.Meals** is a mobile application that was developed using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app consists of two screens, making it less overwhelming for a user to use. **Eazzt.Meals** has the ability to clear information entered by a user as well as enter information entered by a user.

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to provide a user with a variety of meal options based on the time of day, making it fun and easy for a user to use. 

### Features:
- Feature 1: User login functionality
- Feature 2: Display random meal options per time of day
- Feature 3: Clear button, enter button and exit button
- Feature 4: First screen displays where the user will enter the time of day having the enter button as well as the clear button and exit button
- Feature 5: Second screen displays meal choices based on the time of day inputed on the first screen as well as a back button

## Future features:

1. **Feature 1**: Ingredient list
2. **Feature 2**: Having a 3rd screen
3. **Feature 3**: A way to share the meal options with a friend

## Design Considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: Linking the two screens to work effortlessly 
   - **Solution**: I looked at a previous app developed (calculator app) and incorporated my own code
   
2. **Challenge 2**: Having the time of day match with the specific meal option 
   - **Solution**: I did research on Youtube as well as speak to Mr.J.Sookah for clarity

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub**, where all code changes were committed and pushed. This allowed me to keep track of changes.
